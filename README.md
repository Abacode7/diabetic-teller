The process involved in getting diabetes is basically the carbohydrates in the food which we eat is digested in the intestines and convert it into Sugar called glucose, this glucose which is flowing in our blood should be passed to the body cells, so in order to do this the pancreas create a hormone which is insulin, this helps the glucose present in the blood to be flown to body cells. There are different types of Diabetes i.e.

- Tyep-1: No insulin is generated by the pancreas.
- Type-2: Insulin is generated but the body cells are not able to sue them properly.
- Type-3 / gestational diabetes: This is basically caused during the pregnancy which changes the metabolism of a human and these changes are the results of hormones being produced that keep insulin from doing its job.
